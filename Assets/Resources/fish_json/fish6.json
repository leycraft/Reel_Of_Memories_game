"desc": "As its name suggests, this specimen possesses six eyes—though four of them bear an unsettling resemblance to human eyes. Beneath its abdomen are limb-like appendages that mimic the form of human arms and legs. I have never encountered such a creature before, yet there is an inexplicable sense of familiarity, as if I’ve seen it somewhere long ago. I can’t explain this feeling… or what could have happened to this river to give birth to something like this.",
