"location": "Deep sections of the river.",
"desc": "The Marble Goby typically inhabits the riverbed, preying on smaller fish that stray too close. Normally, it lies in wait—motionless—before striking with sudden precision. However, recent observations indicate a behavioral shift. Following the river’s ongoing mutations, the species has become increasingly active and aggressive, abandoning its ambush tactics for a more predatory pursuit. It no longer waits for prey to come near; now…it hunts.",
